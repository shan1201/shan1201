1. Introduction
This report is about the "Cash Register System" program. We have used the C language to code this
program. The program is about making the whole process of taking orders and payment easy for the
cashier. The program will present the menu to the cashier. The cashier will be able to select the
products by pressing the corresponding numbers on the menu list. When the order is complete, the
computer will generate a bill that includes GST. The program then allows the cashier to enter the
amount paid by the customer. The application will then compute the amount of the return and display
it.

2. Scope of Project
This program can be used in many businesses such as restaurants, small shops, cafes, etc. The
program is very easy to make and can be modified with buttons and GUI.

3. Conclusion
This program is helpful in many businesses. For example, in many restaurants, cashiers have to deal
with a long line of customers. They have to take orders and remember them. With the help of this
program, they can take orders fast, and the chances of error will be less.
